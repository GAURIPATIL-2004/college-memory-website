# 🎬 Netflix-Style Video Gallery  

A web-based **Netflix-style video gallery** where users can select a profile and watch videos. I created this project to **store and relive my college memories** by organizing videos in a fun and interactive way.

## 🚀 Why I Created This Project?  

I wanted a **simple, elegant, and engaging way** to keep all my **college memories** in one place.  
Instead of storing them as random files, I designed a **Netflix-like UI** where:  
- Each memory is linked to a profile.  
- Clicking an image **starts the video in full-screen mode**.  
- Users can easily **add new profiles** with custom images.
